## Notes

- A tactical RPG that is... Fast and decisive? Not a puzzle game and still turn based, but basically you should choose your positioning and your tactics and then the scenario plays out in front of you. No more micromanaging each and every move.
- Dying earth genre?
- Lampi√£o
- Mechanics first, art later
- Brasil, Faroeste, Urbano
- Ingles | Portugues
- Upbeat, fun, educational or violence-oriented
- Domenique Dumont + Brasil
- Amazing looking water
- Compelling challenge, pace, goals, anticipation
- Isometric outside of [dungeon], Top-down inside of [dungeon].
- Aseprite + gdevelop?
- How hard to make own engine?
